# WordleHelper
CLI tool that helps you solve the Wordle easier!

To use: simply run "helper.py"!

Note:
- helper.py is very good/quick, but sometimes it will over priortize getting the correct word rather than garrentee that it gets the word within 6 guesses
- helper2.py does not work at all

Example of using  the tool to solve the offical Wordle in 2 guesses for 5/25/22:
